                    Technology
                    Bhopal. QCM is formed by a bunch of quizzing prodigies of Manit in Feb 2013. We are a group of
                    enthusiastic quizzers, executives and designers. The purpose of the society is to promote quizzing,
                    group discussion, debate and to increase the level of general awareness amongst the student
                    community. Quizzers' club conducts various successful events throughout the year in which students
                    from different colleges of India participate.

                    post questions and intresting facts on our social media pages daily to enhance everyone's
                    learning and curiosity.
